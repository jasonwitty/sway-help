# sway-argon-one-up

A complete Sway desktop environment for the [Argon ONE UP CM5 Laptop](https://argon40.com/products/argon-one-up-cm5-laptop-core-system), a 14-inch laptop powered by the Raspberry Pi Compute Module 5. Includes a one-command installer, a 9-theme switcher with matching wallpapers and live terminal recoloring, a dynamic keybinding help overlay, instant brightness control via direct I2C, display scaling controls, battery and power management, and Claude Code integration.

## Quick Install

Starting from a fresh [Raspberry Pi OS Lite](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/) (Trixie, 64-bit) installation:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jasonwitty/sway-argon-one-up/main/install.sh | bash
```

See the [Installation Guide](Installation.md) for detailed step-by-step instructions including how to flash the NVMe drive and configure initial settings.

## Hardware

This setup is built for the [Argon ONE UP CM5 Laptop](https://argon40.com/products/argon-one-up-cm5-laptop-core-system) which uses a Raspberry Pi Compute Module 5. The display is connected via HDMI internally, so standard backlight controls don't apply — brightness is controlled by writing DDC/CI commands directly to the display over I2C bus 14, achieving ~1ms response time. This approach was inspired by [esvertit's display calibration guide](https://forum.argon40.com/t/guide-professional-display-calibration-on-argon-one-up/9188) on the Argon40 forum. The Argon case also has its own battery, monitored by a purpose-built Rust binary ([argon-battery-rs](argon-battery-rs/)).
