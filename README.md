## Hardware

This config is built for the [Argon ONE UP CM5 Laptop](https://argon40.com/products/argon-one-up-cm5-laptop-core-system) which uses a Raspberry Pi Compute Module 5. The display is connected via HDMI internally, so standard backlight controls don't apply — brightness is controlled by writing DDC/CI commands directly to the display over I2C bus 14, achieving ~30ms response time. This approach was inspired by [esvertit's display calibration guide](https://forum.argon40.com/t/guide-professional-display-calibration-on-argon-one-up/9188) on the Argon40 forum, which documented the display's I2C interface and DDC/CI capabilities. The Argon case also has its own battery, monitored via a custom script.

## What's included

| Directory | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `sway/` | Sway config with themed window colors, idle lock, touchpad, media keys |
| `waybar/` | Top bar with workspaces, clock, CPU, volume, backlight, Argon battery, tray, theme/scale/Claude/help/power buttons |
| `sway-themes/` | 9 theme definitions + templates for all themed apps (sway, waybar, foot, mako, swaylock, wofi, wob, Brave, Chromium, Thunar/GTK) |
| `wallpapers/` | Matching wallpaper for each theme (auto-applied on theme switch) |
| `wob/` | Wayland Overlay Bar config for brightness/volume indicators |
| `wofi/` | App launcher and help overlay styles |
| `foot/` | Terminal emulator config + color include (live-recolored on theme switch via OSC sequences) |
| `mako/` | Notification daemon themed to match |
| `swaylock/` | Lock screen with themed ring indicator |
| `gtk-3.0/` | GTK theme settings (switched automatically per theme) |
| `fish/` | Fish shell config |
| `starship.toml` | Starship prompt config |
| `bin/` | `switch-theme`, `sway-scale`, `sway-help`, `claude-prompt`, `brightness`, `start-wob`, `argon-battery`, `lid-suspend`, `powermenu` scripts |

## Media keys

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| **Fn+F2** | Brightness down (direct I2C, ~30ms) |
| **Fn+F3** | Brightness up |
| **Fn+F6** | Mute/unmute |
| **Fn+F7** | Volume down |
| **Fn+F8** | Volume up |
| **Battery key** | Open Argon battery dashboard |

All media keys show a visual indicator via wob (Wayland Overlay Bar).

## sway-help

The help overlay (`bin/sway-help`) parses your sway config every time it runs, so it always reflects your current keybindings. Access it via:

- **Mod+Shift+H** (keyboard shortcut)
- Click the keyboard icon in waybar

Type to filter, Escape to dismiss.

## Claude Code integration

Launch Claude Code directly from Sway:

| Binding | Action |
|---------|--------|
| **Mod+C** | Open Claude in a foot terminal |
| **Mod+Shift+C** | Quick prompt — wofi popup, type a question, Claude opens with it |
| **Waybar icon** | Left-click opens Claude, right-click opens quick prompt |

`claude-prompt` opens a minimal wofi input, takes your question, and launches Claude in foot with that prompt. The terminal stays open after Claude responds so you can continue the conversation.

## Browser integration

| Binding | Action |
|---------|--------|
| **Mod+B** | Launch Brave browser |

Brave is launched with performance flags optimized for the Pi's hardware (`--enable-low-end-device-mode`, `--process-per-site`, etc.). Both Brave and Chromium are themed automatically by the theme switcher via managed policy files — the browser title bar and color scheme update live on theme change, no restart needed.

**Prerequisites:** Install [Brave](https://brave.com/linux/) and/or [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/). Both browsers must be installed for full theme integration. Set up the managed policy directories:

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /etc/brave/policies/managed
sudo mkdir -p /etc/chromium/policies/managed
```

The `switch-theme` script needs passwordless sudo to write the policy files. Add to your sudoers:

```bash
sudo tee /etc/sudoers.d/browser-theme > /dev/null <<EOF
$USER ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/tee /etc/brave/policies/managed/color.json
$USER ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/tee /etc/chromium/policies/managed/color.json
EOF
```

## Theme switcher

Switch between 9 themes with a single click or command. Every themed app updates simultaneously — sway window borders, waybar, foot terminals, mako notifications, swaylock, wofi, wob, GTK apps (including Thunar folder colors), Brave, Chromium, and the wallpaper.

**Available themes:**

<p>

<img src="screenshots/theme-monokai-light.png" width="30%" alt="Monokai Light">
</p>

*Frappe, Mocha, Latte, Macchiato, Dracula, Nord, Gruvbox Dark, Monokai Dark, Monokai Light*

| Method | Action |
|--------|--------|
| **Mod+T** | Open theme picker (wofi) |
| **Waybar palette icon** | Open theme picker |
| `switch-theme <name>` | Switch directly (e.g. `switch-theme dracula`) |
| `switch-theme --wallpaper-picker` | Choose a wallpaper (overrides theme default) |
| `switch-theme --wallpaper <path>` | Set a specific wallpaper |
| `switch-theme --wallpaper-reset` | Revert to the current theme's default wallpaper |

**How it works:**

- Theme definitions in `sway-themes/` set 35 color variables + wallpaper path + GTK theme + Papirus folder color
- Templates in `sway-themes/templates/` use `@@VARIABLE@@` placeholders
- `switch-theme` sources a theme, renders all templates, and applies colors at runtime
- Foot terminals are live-recolored via OSC 4/10/11 escape sequences sent directly to each terminal's pts device — no restart needed
- Brave and Chromium are themed via managed policy files (`/etc/brave/policies/managed/color.json` and `/etc/chromium/policies/managed/color.json`) — the browser reads these live, no restart needed
- GTK apps (including Thunar) update live via gsettings — folder icons change color per theme using `papirus-folders`
- Wallpapers are applied via `swaybg`, with an optional override that persists across theme switches
- Waybar is restarted (via `swaymsg exec` to survive the restart), mako is reloaded, wob is restarted

**Adding a new theme:** Create a file in `sway-themes/` following the existing format (see `sway-themes/dracula` for reference), add a matching wallpaper to `wallpapers/`, and add the name to the `available_flavors()` list in `bin/switch-theme`.

## Display scaling

A waybar module for adjusting Sway's output scale on the fly — useful for finding the right balance between screen real estate and readability.

| Method | Action |
|--------|--------|
| **Waybar magnifier icon** | Open scale picker (wofi) |
| Available steps | 1x, 1.25x, 1.5x, 1.6x, 1.75x, 2x |

The default is 1.6x (1200x750 effective on the 1920x1200 panel). Click to reset to default.

<!--
## WiFi stability

The BCM43455 WiFi chip in the CM5 has aggressive power management that causes intermittent disconnects. This is fixed by disabling WiFi power save:

```bash
sudo tee /etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/wifi-powersave-off.conf > /dev/null <<EOF
[connection]
wifi.powersave = 2
EOF
sudo nmcli general reload
```

Verify with `iw dev wlan0 get power_save` — should show `Power save: off`.
-->

## Standalone guides

These sections explain specific features in detail so you can add them to your own setup without cloning the full config.

### Lid close power management

The Raspberry Pi 5 / CM5 does not support system suspend — there is no `/sys/power/state` or `mem_sleep` interface. Attempting `systemctl suspend` will result in a black screen requiring a hard reboot.

Instead, the lid close script (`bin/lid-suspend`) performs a "soft suspend" by powering down subsystems individually. The Argon ONE UP case detects the lid switch via a GPIO line monitored by its own daemon (`argononeupd.py`), not through the standard ACPI/libinput lid switch — so sway `bindswitch` does not work here.

**What happens on lid close:**

| Action | Savings | Detail |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Lock screen | — | `swaylock -f` |
| Display off | ~1-2W | `swaymsg "output * power off"` |
| CPU governor → powersave | ~200-400mW | Scales frequency down |
| WiFi off | ~150-300mW | `rfkill block wifi` |
| Bluetooth off | ~100-200mW | `rfkill block bluetooth` |
| Webcam unbound | ~100-200mW | USB unbind by vendor ID (`11cc:2812`) |

All actions are reversed on lid open. WiFi reconnects automatically. Events are logged to `~/.local/state/lid-events.log`.

**Setup:**

**1. Configure the Argon daemon** — set `lidaction=suspend` in `/etc/argononeupd.conf`:

```
# /etc/argononeupd.conf
lidshutdownsecs=0
lidaction=suspend
```

The Argon daemon's `argonpowerbutton.py` checks this value and calls `lid-suspend close` / `lid-suspend open` accordingly.

**2. Install the script:**

```bash
cp bin/lid-suspend ~/.local/bin/
chmod +x ~/.local/bin/lid-suspend
```

**3. Add passwordless sudo** for the power management operations:

```bash
sudo tee /etc/sudoers.d/lid-power > /dev/null <<EOF
$USER ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/rfkill block wifi
$USER ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/rfkill unblock wifi
$USER ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/rfkill block bluetooth
$USER ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/rfkill unblock bluetooth
$USER ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/tee /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_governor
$USER ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/tee /sys/bus/usb/drivers/usb/unbind
$USER ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/tee /sys/bus/usb/drivers/usb/bind
EOF
sudo visudo -cf /etc/sudoers.d/lid-power
```

**4. Idle timeout (swayidle)** — separate from the lid, this locks after 5 minutes idle and turns off the display after 10:

```
exec swayidle -w \
    timeout 300 'swaylock -f' \
    timeout 600 'swaymsg "output * power off"' resume 'swaymsg "output * power on"' \
    before-sleep 'swaylock -f'
```

**Important:** Do not configure `logind.conf` to handle the lid switch — there is no standard lid switch device on this hardware, and if logind attempts to suspend it will black-screen the system.

### Power menu

The power button in waybar opens a wofi menu (`bin/powermenu`) with Lock, Reboot, Shutdown, and Logout options. Suspend is intentionally excluded — the Pi 5 / CM5 does not support system suspend and attempting it will black-screen the system.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
choice=$(printf "Lock\nReboot\nShutdown\nLogout" | wofi --dmenu --prompt "Power")

case "$choice" in
  Lock) swaylock ;;
  Reboot) systemctl reboot ;;
  Shutdown) systemctl poweroff ;;
  Logout) swaymsg exit ;;
esac
```

The waybar power button is configured to call this script on click.

### Argon battery in waybar

The Argon ONE UP has its own battery that isn't visible in `/sys/class/power_supply/` — it's accessed via a fuel gauge IC on I2C bus 1 at address `0x64`. A purpose-built Rust binary ([argon-battery-rs](argon-battery-rs/)) replaces the stock Argon Python daemon's battery polling, reducing CPU usage from ~3.5% constant to near zero.

**Features:**
- Battery percentage with level-appropriate icons
- Charging detection with distinct charging icons
- Automatic display brightness adjustment on power state transitions (100% on AC, 40% on battery)
- Automatic CPU governor switching (ondemand on AC, powersave on battery)

See the [argon-battery-rs README](argon-battery-rs/README.md) for build instructions, stock daemon changes, waybar/i3/GNOME integration guides, and customization options.

### Battery key binding

The Argon ONE UP has a battery key between F12 and Print Screen. It registers as `Pause` in Sway:

```
bindsym Pause exec foot -e sudo /usr/bin/python3 /etc/argon/argondashboard.py
```

---

## Initial setup from scratch

This section covers setting up a fresh Argon ONE UP CM5 laptop from a clean Raspberry Pi OS install to a working Sway desktop with this config.

### 1. Flash and boot Raspberry Pi OS

Flash **Raspberry Pi OS Lite** (minimal, no desktop, Debian Trixie-based, 64-bit) to your NVMe or SD card using [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/). The Lite image gives you a clean base without a pre-installed desktop environment. Boot and log in.

### 2. Update the system

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt full-upgrade -y
sudo reboot
```

### 3. Fix NVMe power management (critical)

The Argon ONE UP's NVMe drive can become extremely sluggish or cause I/O timeouts without these kernel parameters. **This was the single biggest stability issue during initial setup — the system was nearly unusable without this fix.**

Edit the kernel command line (**keep everything on one line**):

```bash
sudo nano /boot/firmware/cmdline.txt
```

Append to the existing line:

```
nvme_core.default_ps_max_latency_us=0 pcie_aspm=off
```

This disables NVMe power state transitions and PCIe Active State Power Management, both of which cause latency spikes on the CM5's PCIe bus.

Reboot, then verify no NVMe errors:

```bash
sudo reboot
dmesg -T | grep -i nvme
```

### 4. Install the Argon config tool

This provides battery monitoring, fan control, and power button configuration for the Argon ONE UP case:

```bash
curl https://download.argon40.com/argononeup.sh | bash
```

### 5. Set Wi-Fi regulatory domain

Incorrect settings can cause poor Wi-Fi performance and channel restrictions:

```bash
sudo raspi-config
```

Navigate to **Localisation Options > WLAN Country** and set your country code (e.g. US).

Verify with:

```bash
iw reg get
```

### 6. Enable seat management

Sway needs proper seat access to manage the display and input devices:

```bash
sudo apt install -y seatd
sudo systemctl enable --now seatd
sudo usermod -aG seat,video,audio,input,render "$USER"
sudo reboot
```

Verify after reboot:

```bash
groups  # should include seat, video, audio, input, render
systemctl status seatd  # should be active
```

### 7. Install a login manager

Install GDM (GNOME Display Manager) so you can select Sway as your session at the login screen:

```bash
sudo apt install -y gdm3
sudo systemctl enable gdm
```

After installing Sway (next step), you'll be able to choose **Sway** from the session dropdown on the GDM login screen.

### 8. Install dependencies

Core packages:

```bash
sudo apt install -y \
  sway swaybg swayidle swaylock xwayland \
  waybar wofi foot wob mako-notifier \
  grim slurp wl-clipboard \
  ddcutil i2c-tools pipewire wireplumber \
  network-manager network-manager-gnome \
  ukui-polkit papirus-icon-theme \
  fish fonts-firacode zoxide fzf ugrep
```

Install JetBrainsMono Nerd Font (required for waybar icons):

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.local/share/fonts
curl -fLo /tmp/JetBrainsMono.zip https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/releases/latest/download/JetBrainsMono.zip
unzip -o /tmp/JetBrainsMono.zip -d ~/.local/share/fonts/
fc-cache -fv
```

Install Rust toolchain and CLI tools used by the fish config:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
source ~/.cargo/env
cargo install --locked bat eza pfetch-rs
```

Install [Starship](https://starship.rs/) prompt and [Atuin](https://atuin.sh/) shell history:

```bash
curl -sS https://starship.rs/install.sh | sh
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -LsSf https://setup.atuin.sh | sh
```

Optional but recommended:

```bash
sudo apt install -y \
  firefox-esr thunar mpv imv zathura file-roller chromium
```

### 8b. Install GTK themes and Papirus folder colors

The theme switcher sets a matching GTK theme and Papirus folder icon color for each theme. Install the GTK themes to `~/.themes/`:

- **Catppuccin GTK** — download from [catppuccin/gtk](https://github.com/catppuccin/gtk/releases) (mocha, frappe, latte, macchiato — blue, standard+default variants)
- **Dracula GTK** — download from [dracula/gtk](https://github.com/dracula/gtk/releases)
- **Nordic GTK** — download from [EliverLara/Nordic](https://github.com/EliverLara/Nordic/releases)
- **Gruvbox GTK** — download from [Fausto-Korpsvansen/Gruvbox-GTK-Theme](https://github.com/Fausto-Korpsvansen/Gruvbox-GTK-Theme) (Gruvbox-Dark)
- **Monokai GTK** — download from [Maikuolan/Monokai](https://github.com/Maikuolan/Monokai)

Extract each into `~/.themes/` so they appear as e.g. `~/.themes/Dracula/`, `~/.themes/Nordic/`, etc. Monokai Light uses the built-in Adwaita theme (no download needed).

Install the `papirus-folders` script for per-theme folder icon colors:

```bash
curl -fLo ~/.local/bin/papirus-folders \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PapirusDevelopmentTeam/papirus-folders/master/papirus-folders
chmod +x ~/.local/bin/papirus-folders
```

For Brave browser, follow the [official install guide](https://brave.com/linux/). Both Brave and Chromium are themed automatically by the theme switcher. Set up the policy directories for browser theming:

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /etc/brave/policies/managed /etc/chromium/policies/managed
sudo tee /etc/sudoers.d/browser-theme > /dev/null <<EOF
$USER ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/tee /etc/brave/policies/managed/color.json
$USER ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/tee /etc/chromium/policies/managed/color.json
EOF
```

### 9. Install socktop

[socktop](https://socktop.io) is a TUI-first remote system monitor. It's used by the waybar CPU module (click to open). Install from the apt repo:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://jasonwitty.github.io/socktop/KEY.gpg | \
    sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/socktop-archive-keyring.gpg

echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/socktop-archive-keyring.gpg] https://jasonwitty.github.io/socktop stable main" | \
    sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/socktop.list

sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y socktop socktop-agent
sudo systemctl enable --now socktop-agent
```

### 10. Copy this config

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/jasonwitty/sway-argon-one-up.git
cd sway-argon-one-up

# Copy configs
cp -r sway waybar wob wofi foot mako swaylock gtk-3.0 sway-themes fish ~/.config/
cp starship.toml ~/.config/
cp -r wallpapers ~/.wallpapers
mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
cp bin/* ~/.local/bin/
chmod +x ~/.local/bin/*
```

### 11. Build and install argon-battery-rs

The battery monitor is a Rust binary that reads the Argon battery gauge directly over I2C. It powers the waybar battery indicator, auto-adjusts brightness, and switches CPU governor on AC/battery transitions. See the [argon-battery-rs README](argon-battery-rs/README.md) for full details including stock daemon changes.

```bash
cd argon-battery-rs
cargo build --release
sudo cp target/release/argon-battery-rs /usr/local/bin/
```

### 12. Set up lid close power management

The lid-suspend script and sudoers config are required for the lid to properly lock, blank the display, and save power when closed. See the [Lid close power management](#lid-close-power-management) standalone guide for full details, but the short version:

```bash
# Sudoers for passwordless power management
sudo tee /etc/sudoers.d/lid-power > /dev/null <<EOF
$USER ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/rfkill block wifi
$USER ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/rfkill unblock wifi
$USER ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/rfkill block bluetooth
$USER ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/rfkill unblock bluetooth
$USER ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/tee /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_governor
$USER ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/tee /sys/bus/usb/drivers/usb/unbind
$USER ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/tee /sys/bus/usb/drivers/usb/bind
EOF
sudo visudo -cf /etc/sudoers.d/lid-power
```

Configure the Argon daemon in `/etc/argononeupd.conf`:

```
lidshutdownsecs=0
lidaction=suspend
```

### 13. Log in to Sway

Reboot, and at the GDM login screen select **Sway** from the session menu (gear icon). If everything is set up correctly, you should see the Catppuccin-themed desktop with waybar at the top.

If Sway fails to start, check:

```bash
journalctl -b --no-pager | tail -200
systemctl status seatd
groups  # make sure seat group is present
```

### 14. Install Claude Code (optional)

For the Mod+C integration:

```bash
# See https://claude.ai/claude-code for installation
claude  # run once to authenticate
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### System is extremely slow / NVMe timeouts

The most common issue. Check that the kernel parameters are set:

```bash
cat /proc/cmdline | grep nvme_core
```

If `nvme_core.default_ps_max_latency_us=0` and `pcie_aspm=off` are not present, see step 3 above.

### Brightness keys don't work

Check that the display is accessible over I2C bus 14:

```bash
sudo i2cdetect -y 14  # should show device at 0x37
ddcutil --bus 14 getvcp 10  # should return current brightness
```

The brightness script writes DDC/CI commands directly to `/dev/i2c-14`. Make sure your user has access (should be in the `i2c` or `render` group).

### No sound / volume keys don't work

This config uses PipeWire with WirePlumber (`wpctl`), not PulseAudio (`pactl`):

```bash
wpctl status
wpctl get-volume @DEFAULT_AUDIO_SINK@
```

### Lid close doesn't do anything / no power savings

The Argon ONE UP uses a GPIO-based lid switch, not a standard ACPI lid. Sway `bindswitch` and `logind.conf` `HandleLidSwitch` will not work. The lid is handled entirely by the Argon daemon.

Check that the Argon daemon is running and configured:

```bash
systemctl status argononed  # daemon should be active
cat /etc/argononeupd.conf   # should contain lidaction=suspend
```

Check the lid event log to see if the script is being called:

```bash
cat ~/.local/state/lid-events.log
```

A successful close/open cycle looks like:

```
=== LID CLOSE 2026-04-03 10:01:06 ===
  display: off
  cpu governor: powersave
  wifi: Soft blocked: yes
  bluetooth: Soft blocked: yes
  webcam (1-1.4): unbound
=== LID OPEN 2026-04-03 10:04:45 ===
  display: on
  cpu governor: ondemand
  wifi: Soft blocked: no
  bluetooth: Soft blocked: no
  webcam (1-1.4): bound
```

If the log file doesn't exist, the script isn't being called. Verify:

- `/etc/argononeupd.conf` has `lidaction=suspend`
- `~/.local/bin/lid-suspend` exists and is executable
- The Argon daemon's `argonpowerbutton.py` has the suspend case that calls `lid-suspend`

If the log shows a subsystem failed (e.g. `webcam: not found`), the webcam vendor ID (`11cc:2812`) may not match your hardware. Check with `lsusb` and update the IDs in the script.

### Black screen after lid close (hard reboot required)

This means something attempted a real system suspend. The Pi 5 / CM5 has no suspend support — it will freeze. Check:

```bash
# Make sure logind is NOT trying to handle the lid
grep -r HandleLidSwitch /etc/systemd/logind.conf /etc/systemd/logind.conf.d/ 2>/dev/null
```

All `HandleLidSwitch` values should be commented out or set to `ignore`. The safest option is to not have any overrides — the Argon GPIO daemon handles the lid, not logind.

Also make sure the powermenu does not include a Suspend option (`systemctl suspend` will black-screen).

### Waybar or wob missing after sway reload

These use `exec_always` and should survive reloads. If they don't appear, check the processes:

```bash
pgrep waybar
pgrep wob
```

And restart manually if needed: `swaymsg reload`
